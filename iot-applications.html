    <h1>IoT Apps</h2>

    <p>IoT apps analyse vast volumes of linked sensor data in the cloud using machine learning techniques. IoT applications include a variety of properties, including artificial intelligence, connection, dynamic nature, etc. Smartphone applications, fitness trackers, biometric security systems, and other items are some examples of IoT applications. </p>

    <h1>Smart Building</h2>

    <p>A smart building is one that makes use of technology to provide residents with a safe and comfortable environment while enabling efficient and economical resource utilisation. A broad variety of current technology may be used in smart buildings, which are also built in a way that makes it possible to include emerging technologies.
        Building management systems, artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality, and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are a few of the robots and processes that may be utilised in a smart building to regulate and enhance its performance. A smart building could include characteristics like an air quality monitoring system, fire and earthquake detection, structural health detection, intelligent parking, and intelligent security.
        The new Apple headquarters is a fantastic example of a clever structure.

    <p>Therefore, some characteristics that might be incorporated in a smart parking lot include: AI-assisted parking, management, Light-directed Parking, Car lifts, wireless charging, automated temperature management, and smoke and fire detection systems. Development of such a Smart Parking lot will require the following at a minimum: system of high-security cameras, database to keep track of residents' parked autos,
        burglar alarm, Ultrasonic and motion sensors, LED lighting for light-directed parking, temperature sensors for temperature management in the parking, electric vehicle charging stations
